Problem 1

Raw Data: Dataset is from The Washington Post who gathered data on
homicides in 50 large U.S. cities and made the data available through
GitHub repository. The dataset contains variables such as latitude,
longitude, state, city, victim\_sex, victim\_age, victim\_race, first
name, last name report number, and dispostion. The dataset contains
52178 observations.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved", 
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved", 
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Prop test for a single city (Baltimore\_MD)

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),      
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

Iterating into a dataframe

``` r
results_df=
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Take a look at the results data frame

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high))+
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of unsolved Homicides by City"
  )+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))

Overtime, the observations in the control arm have parily constant
values while the observations in the exerimental arm seems to be
increasing over time.

Testing the fucntion

Running simulations and putting into dataframe

  output[[i]] = 
    rerun(5000, sim_t.test(mu = mu_list[[i]]))
    
sim_results = bind_rows(output)

Graphing the results

``` r

As the true value of my increases, so does power (proportion of times
the null is rejected). The power maximizes around when the true mean is
between 3 and 4, where the curve flattens out at 1 after 4.

``` r
sim_results_rej = 
  sim_results_df %>%
    mutate(reject = ifelse(p.value < '0.05', 1, 0)) %>%
    filter(reject == 1) %>% 
    group_by(mu) %>%
    summarize(mean_mu = mean(estimate)) %>%
    mutate(decision = "rejected")
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
sim_results_all = 
  sim_results_df %>% 
    mutate(reject = ifelse(p.value < '0.05', 1, 0)) %>% 
    group_by(mu) %>% 
    summarize(mean_mu = mean(estimate)) %>% 
    mutate(decision = "all")
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
ggplot(data = sim_results_all, aes(x = mu, y = mean_mu, color = decision)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = sim_results_rej) +
  labs(
    title = "True mu vs. Estimated mu",
    x = "True Value of mu",
    y = "Mean Estimated Value of mu")
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_ly2496_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />
We see that as the true value of mu increases after 3, the mean
estimated value of mu for when the null was rejected diverges further
(is smaller) from the true value of mu.
